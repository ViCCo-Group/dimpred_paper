## Caveat
Note that some image sets were misnomered initially and those misnomers escalated through all scripts and data objects. These incorrect image set labels have only been corrected in the manuscript but not in any script. This file serves to prevent possible confusion.

| Image set label in scripts | Image set label in manuscript |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 48nonref | 48-image-generalization |
| 48new | 48-concept-generalization |
| Kriegeskorte-92 | Mur-92 |
| Kriegeskorte-118 | Cichy-118 |
